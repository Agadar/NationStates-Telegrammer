# Agadar's NationStates Telegrammer

This desktop application allows you to automate sending telegrams to other nations, making it useful for recruiting, World Assembly campaigning, region-wide telegramming, and so forth. It only requires Java to be installed on your machine in order to run.

Before you use this program, make sure you're familiar with the [Telegrams API](https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html#telegrams). You should know how to obtain a Client Key, and how to create a telegram template. Once you've obtained a Client Key, a Telegram Id, and a Secret Key, you're ready to start using this program.

**_If you're looking for a guide on how to obtain the keys and a Telegram Id, check out [Ever-Wandering Souls](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=ever-wandering_souls)' [Simple Guide to Sending Telegrams via API](http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=350586)!_**

This program uses my own [NationStates API Java Wrapper](https://github.com/Agadar/NationStates-api-java-wrapper) to communicate with the NationStates API.
